SMS::AQL  README
===========================

SMS::AQL is a simple module which provides a clean
object-oriented interface to allow sending of SMS text messages
to mobile phones using the HTTP gateway from AQL (www.aql.com).

In order to use AQL's gateway, you will need to get an account
with them (free), and purchase some credits (not free obviously).

Note, I have no connection to AQL other than being a user of their
services.  I started writing this module for myself, then thought 
I should do the Right Thing and release it to CPAN.

I contacted AQL to discuss doing this and ask for some test SMS
credits to assist with testing the module, and they were most
helpful - thanks guys, you're a top company :)


INSTALLATION

To install this module use the standard routine:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install


DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  LWP


PROXY SUPPORT

If you provide a proxy setting in the options when instantiating the object,
it will be passed through to LWP.  If the proxy requires authentication, then
supply the username and password in the proxy URL, like so:

 http://user:pass@host:port/
 
If you don't need a username and password, leave them out.

An example:

my $sms = new SMS::AQL({
    username => 'user',
    password => 'pass',
    options => {
        proxy => 'http://user:pass@host:port/',
    }
});
