SMS::AQL version 0.03
===========================

SMS::AQL is a simple module which provides a clean
object-oriented interface to allow sending of SMS text messages
to mobile phones using the HTTP gateway from AQL (www.aql.com).

In order to use AQL's gateway, you will need to get an account
with them (free), and purchase some credits (not free obviously).

Note, I have no connection to AQL other than being a user of their
services.  I started writing this module for myself, then thought 
I should do the Right Thing and release it to CPAN.

I contacted AQL to discuss doing this and ask for some test SMS
credits to assist with testing the module, and they were most
helpful - thanks guys, you're a top company :)

This initial release is fairly limited, but works, at least for UK
mobiles... I haven't had the opportunity to test it with any non-UK
mobiles.  If anybody from outside of the UK wants to be kind enough
to help test it, please contact me.
