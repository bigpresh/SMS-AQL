Net-AQSMS-Send version 0.01
===========================

Net::AQSMS::Send is a simple module which provides a clean
object-oriented interface to allow sending of SMS text messages
to mobile phones using the HTTP gateway from AQL (www.aql.com).

In order to use AQL's gateway, you will need to get an account
with them (free), and purchase some credits (not free obviously).

Note, I have no connection to AQL other than being a user of their
services.  I started writing this module for myself, then thought 
I should do the Right Thing and release it to CPAN.
