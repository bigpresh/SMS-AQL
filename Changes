Revision history for Perl extension SMS::AQL.

0.09
Example script eg/send-sms added (useful for other programs to call, I use
this from procmail to alert me when specific emails come in).


0.08 2008-03-18
Support for voice push messages (strictly speaking this ought to be in
a seperate module as it's not an SMS-related feature, but it makes sense
to group with here I think.  If I ever do seperate it, I'll probably go
for Net::AQL::SMS and Net::AQL::Voice, and have them use Net::AQL::Common
for shared implementation.)

0.07 2008-01-14
Minor changes to boost Kwalitee score on cpants.perl.org - mostly updated
META.yml (and also adding LWP::UserAgent as a pre-req in Makefile.PL)

0.06 2007-08-22
Changes to make SMS::AQL work under prehistoric perl 5.005

0.05 2007-08-14
Added support for connecting via a proxy - simply supply the proxy URL in
the options hashref when instantiating the object:
my $sms = new SMS::AQL({
    username => 'user',
    password => 'pass',
    options => {
        proxy => 'http://user:pass@host:port/',
    }
});

New release incorporating several improvements kindly submitted by
Ton Voon at Altinity (http://www.altinity.com/) - thanks Ton!  There's
numerous documentation improvements, better parsing of server responses,
and a new test script using Test::MockObject to exercise the module
code without actually interacting with the AQL servers or sending 
messages.  Nice work Ton, thanks for your contribution!


0.03  2007-06-26
Previous versions had use 5.008007 in the Makefile, where I forgot to
change it.  There's nothing funky in this module that should require
5.8.7, 5.8.0 should be good enough.  Thanks to Nicola W for pointing
this out.

Also added new credit() method to return the number of message credits
available on the account.

Fix stupid, stupid bug #24201 - don't remove servers from the list of 
servers, unless we fail to send a message.  Previously, each instance 
of SMS::AQL could only send 4 messages in a row before starting to fail.
Obviously, passed all tests, only showed up in real usage.  Wibble.  
Also some minor style problems cleared up.

Important: constructor now takes a hashref of params to provide for 
future expansion needs.

development starts... pre-alpha version started life as Net::AQSMS::Send, 
name SMS::AQL was then agreed after brief discussion with modules@perl.org 
guys, Brian in particular - thanks for your input Brian.

Initial version is quite limited, but tested and works well for me.  
Not tested with non-UK destination numbers.
