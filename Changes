Revision history for Perl extension SMS::AQL.

0.01  Thu Aug 10 22:13:16 2006
development starts... pre-alpha version started life as
Net::AQSMS::Send, name SMS::AQL was then agreed after
brief discussion with modules@perl.org guys, Brian in
particular - thanks for your input Brian.

Initial version is quite limited, but tested and works
well for me.  Not tested with non-UK destination numbers.
