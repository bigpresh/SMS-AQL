Revision history for Perl extension SMS::AQL.

0.04 16/07/2007
New release incorporating several improvements kindly submitted by
Ton Voon at Altinity (http://www.altinity.com/) - thanks Ton!  There's
numerous documentation improvements, better parsing of server responses,
and a new test script using Test::MockObject to exercise the module
code without actually interacting with the AQL servers or sending 
messages.  Nice work Ton, thanks for your contribution!

Previous versions had use 5.008007 in the Makefile, where I forgot to
change it.  There's nothing funky in this module that should require
5.8.7, 5.8.0 should be good enough.  Thanks to Nicola W for pointing
this out.

Also added new credit() method to return the number of message credits
available on the account.

Fix stupid, stupid bug #24201 - don't remove servers from the list of 
servers, unless we fail to send a message.  Previously, each instance 
of SMS::AQL could only send 4 messages in a row before starting to fail.
Obviously, passed all tests, only showed up in real usage.  Wibble.  
Also some minor style problems cleared up.

Important: constructor now takes a hashref of params to provide for 
future expansion needs.

development starts... pre-alpha version started life as Net::AQSMS::Send, 
name SMS::AQL was then agreed after brief discussion with modules@perl.org 
guys, Brian in particular - thanks for your input Brian.

Initial version is quite limited, but tested and works well for me.  
Not tested with non-UK destination numbers.
