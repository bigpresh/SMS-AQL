Revision history for Perl extension SMS::AQL.

0.02  04/01/2007
Fix stupid, stupid bug #24201 - don't remove servers
from the list of servers, unless we fail to send a
message.  Previously, each instance of SMS::AQL could
only send 4 messages in a row before starting to fail.
Obviously, passed all tests, only showed up in real
usage.  Wibble.  Also some minor style problems
cleared up.

Important: constructor now takes a hashref of params to
provide for future expansion needs.

development starts... pre-alpha version started life as
Net::AQSMS::Send, name SMS::AQL was then agreed after
brief discussion with modules@perl.org guys, Brian in
particular - thanks for your input Brian.

Initial version is quite limited, but tested and works
well for me.  Not tested with non-UK destination numbers.
